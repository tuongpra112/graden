Middleware is a function that sits between the client and the server and performs some 
operations on the incoming request or outgoing response. In the context of web development, 
middleware functions are used to add additional functionality to the server, such as 
authentication, logging, error handling, and more.

In the case of Node.js and Express, middleware functions are functions that have access 
to the `request` and `response` objects, and the `next` function in the application's 
request-response cycle. They can modify the request and response objects, or terminate 
the request-response cycle by sending a response to the client.

Middleware functions can be used globally for all routes, or for specific routes or 
groups of routes. They can be defined using the `app.use()` method, or as a parameter 
to a specific route or group of routes.
